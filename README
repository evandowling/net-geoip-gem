	require 'net/geoip'
	Net::GeoIP::TYPE_DISK                 >> access type constant
	Net::GeoIP::TYPE_RAM                  >> access type constant

	g = Net::GeoIP.new([access_type])
	g = Net::GeoIP.open(db_filename[, access_type])
	Net::GeoIP.update_database(your_key_here[,debug])

	g.country_code_by_addr('127.0.0.1')   >> 'US'
	g.country_code_by_name('yahoo.com')   >> 'US'
	g.country_code3_by_addr('127.0.0.1')  >> 'USA'
	g.country_code3_by_name('yahoo.com')  >> 'USA'
	g.country_name_by_addr('127.0.0.1')   >> 'United States'
	g.country_name_by_name('yahoo.com')   >> 'United States'
	g.country_id_by_addr('127.0.0.1')     >> 225
	g.country_id_by_name('yahoo.com')     >> 225
	g.region_by_addr('127.0.0.1')         >> ?? Can't test this
	g.region_by_name('yahoo.com')         >> ?? Can't test this

If an address doesn't have a country code, code3, or name, the library
returns nil.  For country_id_by_*, Net::GeoIP returns 0 for countries
it can't find.
